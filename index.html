    <h1>See You Again</h1>

<p>It's been a long day without you, my friend <br>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again <br>
We've come a long way from where we began <br>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br>
When I see you again <br> <br>  </td> </tr>

Damn, who knew? <br>
All the planes we flew, good things we been through <br>
That I'd be standing right here talking to you <br>
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh <br>
But something told me that it wouldn't last <br>
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture <br>
Those were the days, hard work forever pays <br>
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place) <br>
Uh <br> <br>
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got? <br>
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side <br>
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride <br> <br>
It's been a long day without you, my friend <br>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again) <br>
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way) <br>
From where we began (you know we started) <br>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you) <br>
When I see you again <br> <br>
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong <br>
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond <br>
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost <br>
(The love will never get lost) <br>
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed <br>
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn <br>
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone <br>
(Remember me when I'm gone) <br> <br>
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got? <br>
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side <br>
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride <br> <br>
So let the light guide your way, yeah <br>
Hold every memory as you go <br>
And every road you take <br>
Will always lead you home, home <br> <br>
It's been a long day without you, my friend <br>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again <br>
We've come a long way from where we began <br>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again <br>
When I see you again <br> <br>
When I see you again (yeah, uh) <br>
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah) <br> <br>
When I see you again</p>
